Map Making Startup Template

This is a custom startup template for blender. there are 3 locked viewports that require an addon to retain its locking, so install the addons included first before copying this folder to the bl_app_templates_user folder. there is two levels of grid snapping enabled, blender's built in snap was left on at 0.25 units. it can be disabled, however the other snapping addon will then take priority, you can set snap from the "N key" tabs on the right, under the simple grid stap tab. you can create brushes and sectors with level buddy, also available under the N key tabs. The file is automatically set up with my asset lib, which can be replaced with a different material library. pls be aware as of now, theres no way to export BSP/VMF files (Yet).

Install instructions:
copy the included addons to your blender addons folder.
for linux users its usually in $HOME/.config/blender/ver.num/scripts/addons/.
For windows %appdata%\Blender Foundation\Blender\ver.num\scripts\addons\.
and mac /Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Blender/ver.num/scripts/addons/

for windows %appdata%\Blender Foundation\Blender\ver.num\scripts\startup\bl_app_templates_user
